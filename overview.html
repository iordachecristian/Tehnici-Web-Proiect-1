                    <p>THIS IS BATTLE ROYALE</p>
                    <p>Our BATTLE ROYALE game-mode will put up to 100 players on a remote island for a winner-takes-allshowdown where strategic gameplay is as important as shooting skills. </p>
                    <p>Players will enter a last-man-standing battle where they try to locate weapons, vehicles and supplies in a graphically and tactically rich battleground that eventually forces players into a shrinking play zone as they engage in a tense and spectacular fight to the death.</p>

                    <h3>Who is PlayerUnknown?</h3>
                    <p>PLAYERUNKNOWN (Brendan Greene - Creative Director at Bluehole) is the pioneer of the Battle Royale genre. </p>
                    <p>From humble beginnings creating the Battle Royale game-mode on the ARMA series, he went on to license his game-mode to Sony Online Entertainment (now Daybreak Games) for inclusion in their title H1Z1.</p>
                    <p>Now working as creative director on BATTLEGROUNDS, 
                        he has finally the chance to create his own version of the game-mode which spawned a new genre in gaming.</p>
